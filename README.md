## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vedantbhor2110/task.git
cd task

'''bash
npm install
npx expo start

'''Dependancies
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage expo-notifications expo-device

**Design & Challenges**
_Used AsyncStorage to persist tasks even after app restarts.

Integrated local notifications using expo-notifications, but faced limitations in Expo Go for remote push notifications (SDK 53).

Clean UI with basic error handling for empty task input.

Used FlatList and useState/useEffect for state management and rendering tasks dynamically.
